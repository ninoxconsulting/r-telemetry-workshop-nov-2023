Data Catalogue (9:00 - 10:30)\n- **BREAK** (10:30 - 11:00)\n- Getting and working with raster data (Part I; 11:00 - 12:30)\n- **LUNCH** (12:30 - 1:30)\n- Preparing  base data for telemetry analysis (Part II; 1:30 - 3:00)\n- **BREAK** (3:00 - 3:30)\n- Preparing data for Resource Selection Function (RSF) analysis (3:30 - 4:30)\n\n## Computing requirements\n\nYou will require the following software installed and configured for the workshop. Please have this set up and ready to go **before** we start.\n\nYou will need:\n\n-   A laptop computer, preferably with administrative privileges\n-   [R and RStudio](#install-r-and-rstudio)\n-   [Several R packages](#packages)\n-   [QGIS](qgis) (optional)\n\n### Install R and RStudio {#install-r-and-rstudio}\n\nYou will need:\n\n-   R version \\>= 4.2.0\n-   RStudio \\>= 2023.03.1\n\n#### Install R\n\nDownload and install R for your operating system from <https://cloud.r-project.org/>.\n\n##### Windows with no admin rights:\n\nIf you do not have administrator rights, the installer will default to installing somewhere in your user folder (e.g., `C:/Users/username/AppData/Local/Programs/`). If you prefer, you can change the location to another folder that you have write access to, just make sure it is on your `C:/` drive.\n\n#### Install R Studio\n\nDownload and install RStudio Desktop from <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>. This page should automatically offer you the version suitable for your operating system, but you can scroll down to find versions for all operating systems.\n\n##### Windows with admin rights:\n\nDownload the `.zip` archive for Windows under \"Zip/Tarballs\". Create a folder called `RStudio` in a location on your `C:/` drive, where you have write access (e.g. `C:/Users/username/AppData/Local/Programs/RStudio`), and extract the zip file into this folder. Find the RStudio program in this folder: it is named `rstudio.exe`, but the file extension will typically be hidden, so look for `rstudio`. Right-click this file to create a shortcut and drag it to your desktop/task bar. Use the shortcut to open RStudio.\n\n### Install packages {#packages}\n\nIn R, install the necessary packages by running:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\n  c(\"tidyverse\", \"sf\", \"terra\", \"mapview\", \"bcdata\", \"bcmaps\", \"readxl\", \n    \"ggplot2\", \"usethis\", \"lubridate\", \"ggdensity\",\"ggspatial\", \"prettymapr\")\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### QGIS (optional) {#qgis}\n\nQGIS is a free and open-source geographic information system (GIS) that allows you to create, edit, visualize, analyze and publish geospatial information.\n\nDownload and install from the [QGIS website](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html).\n\n## Workshop materials and data\n\nWe have created an empty RStudio project containing the workshop data.\n\nThe easiest way to get started to run:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nusethis::use_course(\"https://github.com/ninoxconsulting/r-telemetry-workshop-nov-2023/raw/main/r-telemetry-workshop.zip\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n✔ Downloading from\n'https://github.com/ninoxconsulting/r-telemetry-workshop-nov-2023/raw/main/r-telemetry-workshop.zip'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nDownloaded: 0.01 MB  (1%)\nDownloaded: 0.01 MB  (1%)\nDownloaded: 0.01 MB  (1%)\nDownloaded: 0.01 MB  (1%)\nDownloaded: 0.01 MB  (1%)\nDownloaded: 0.01 MB
