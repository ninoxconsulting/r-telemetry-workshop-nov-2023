If you prefer, you can change the location to another folder that you have write access to, just make sure it is on your `C:/` drive.\n\n#### Install R Studio\n\nDownload and install RStudio Desktop from <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>.\nThis page should automatically offer you the version suitable for your operating system, but you can scroll down to find versions for all operating systems.\n\n##### Windows with no admin rights:\n\nDownload the `.zip` archive for Windows under \"Zip/Tarballs\". Create a folder called `RStudio` in a location on your `C:/` drive, where you have write access (e.g. `C:/Users/username/AppData/Local/Programs/RStudio`), and extract the zip file into this folder. Find the RStudio program in this folder: it is named `rstudio.exe`, but the file extension will typically be hidden, so look for `rstudio`. Right-click this file to create a shortcut and drag it to your desktop/task bar. Use the shortcut to open RStudio.\n\n### Install packages {#packages}\n\nIn R, install the necessary packages by running:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\n  c(\"tidyverse\", \"sf\", \"terra\", \"tmap\", \"mapview\", \"bcdata\", \"bcmaps\", \"readxl\")\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### QGIS {#qgis}\n\nQGIS is a free and open-source geographic information system (GIS) that allows you to create, edit, visualize, analyze and publish geospatial information.\n\nDownload and install from the [QGIS website](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html).\n",
